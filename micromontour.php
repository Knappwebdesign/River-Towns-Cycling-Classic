            <p>Organizers created this race as the “gateway drug” into the Mon-tour series of races. This course has the flavor of the full Mon-Tour race, but without the distance and crushing elevation gain. It’s still a challenging ride (if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be allowed to play with it two older sister races). However, the course design allows any cyclist with basic fitness to complete the course and begin their descent into the hell that is the full Mon-tour.</p>
            <p>The Micro Mon-Tour is part of BOTH the River Towns Race Series, and the Central Susquehanna Cycling Series. The River Towns race series is a cross discipline series of running, triathlon and cycling events. The Central Susquehanna Cycling Series is a three race road cycling series, that features three hilly rides all between 20 and 30 miles in length. Please feel free to use the links provided to find out more about both of these fun series!</p>

            <br>
            <p>These races will be fully supported. SAG support for the entire race. A wheel drop/feed zone at mile 44 of the full Mon-Tour race. We will have mechanics on site, bathroom facilities, Food, Drink and parking all available within walking distance of the Start location. Geisinger Sports Medicine will provide dedicated medical staff, in the event that any medical help is needed. The Expo area and event parking is the Start location for this event, so we expect good spectator participation. The Micro, Mini, and Mon-tour Road races will each be chip timed.</p>

            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Because this is a River Towns Race Series race, riders will be awarded points toward the series based on our 11 age groups. Because the Micro is a Central Susquehanna Cycling Series race, riders will also be awarded proper points toward that series as well. There will be finisher medals for all finishers of all three road races. There will be an awards ceremony for top three finishers in the Mens, Womens, and Teams categories of each race. Sanctioned racers will receive their points towards category classifications. Teams will receive the Mon-Tour cup, engraving of their team name and member racers, and a cash prize (to be determined based in participation).</p>
