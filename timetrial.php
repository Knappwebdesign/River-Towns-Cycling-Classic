            <p>A Time Trial is a road race that pits rider against the clock exclusively. You ride alone (unless you catch someone that started at an interval ahead of you). There is no drafting, or teams or strategy besides, “GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN!”. For a race like this, we choose a relatively flat course. No giant hills, but instead “rolling” hills. This is an out and back race, so you may see something on the way out, that you can capitalize on the way back to improve your time.</p>
            <p>There is a Rail Road track crossing on this course, so caution will need to be taken at this area.</p>
            <p>The roads will be open to traffic, but the road is lightly traveled and as a result, should be a very good venue for this type of cycling activity.</p>
            <p>The time trial is part of the combined "King of the Road" award.  Your time in the Time Trial will be multipled by 5, and that time added to your overall time for the three events (Road race and Crit, being the other two events).</p>
            <p>There is no firm start time for the time trials and no seeding.  Organizers have decided to run the Time Trial in this way to provide all riders the utmost flexibility in regard to the races they want to attend and/or participate.</p>
            <p>We realize that this will detract from the fan experience, but Organizers feel the need for flexibility for our riders outweighs the fan experience in this situation.</p>
            <p>Spotters will be located at the turn around point, and randomely along the course and in vehicles to make sure the race is conduceted fairly and according to the rules.</p>
            <p>The Time Trials will simply start at 9:00 a.m. and continue throughout the day until the very last slot available at 6:00 p.m.  Choose your time wisely.  Don't wait too long, weather, and the possibility of a line pushing you out past 6:00 p.m. could be a bummer.</p>
            <p>Riders will be allowed to leave the starting ramp every 2:00 minutes.</p>

            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <p>Because this is a River Towns Race Series race, riders will be awarded points toward the series based on our 11 age groups. There will be an awards ceremony for top three finishers in the Mens, Womens, and Teams categories of each category race. Sanctioned racers will receive their points towards category classifications. Teams will receive a cash prize (to be determined based in participation).</p>
