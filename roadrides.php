            <!-- General -->
            <p>On Saturday the River Towns Cycling Classic will offer a full day of locally hosted road rides. These rides will start Expo area at 8:00 a.m. They will officially end at 4:00 p.m., but of course no riders are required to stay with the ride any longer than they would like. The rides will be divided into two parts: 8:00 a.m. to noon, and 1:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. with a one hour lunch break in between. The first portion of the ride will include less elevation gain than the second portion. There is no set route, but the routes will deviate from race routes. That way, you won’t have to worry about riding all the same roads on two different days. We aren’t making set routes because we want your guides to be able to work with your group to deliver the best possible experience.</p>

            <p>Speaking of your guides, they will be representatives of local bicycle shops and they will know all the best roads to ride in the area. Central PA people are known for their friendliness and pride in our community. The guides are always willing to adjust and share as much as they can about the countryside you are seeing.</p>

            <!-- Pace -->
            <p><b>Pace</b> - The pace of the ride will be leisurely. Not slow, but definitely not fast. If you want more challenge in the second half of the day, maybe your group can talk about that at lunch and your guide will plan accordingly.</p>

            <!-- Lunch -->
            <p><b>Lunch</b> - To keep things simple, we are NOT including the lunch in the cost of the road riding guided tours. Instead, your Guide will return you to Danville at Noon, so that you can use your $5.00 River Towns Cycling Series Voucher at any of the downtown businesses or at any of the vendors at the Fall Arts Festival that will be happening on Mill Street, in Danville during your ride. Mill Street and the Arts Festival will offer varieties of food and drink to match any desire or diet consideration. So instead of sticking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a banana in a bag and calling that “lunch”, we decided to do this instead.</p>

            <!-- TIP -->
            <p><b>Tip</b> - Columbia County has one of the highest concentration of covered bridges in the nation. If you are interested in seeing them, perhaps, you might mention that fact to your guide.</p>

            <!-- Cost -->
            <p><b>Cost</b> - $45.00/person ( a bargain for 8 solid hours of guided riding).</p>

            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p>
            These rides are NOT SUPPORTED by any type of full time sag wagon. You will be expected to bring a bike and all the supplies needed to complete a full day of bike riding. Tubes, pump, maybe a tire, snacks, and drinks are all HIGHLY ENCOURAGED. We won’t tell you what you need; you know yourself and your bike better than we know you and your riding ability. All we can tell you is that if you are unable to continue, it could be some time until we can provide a vehicle to return you to the EXPO base location. So please plan accordingly. No one wants to be “that guy”.

            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <p>
               There are no awards or prizes for a ride. When you get home and look at your photos and feel your legs as you walk down steps, that will be all the “award” you need.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="bit-1">
            <h2>Swag</h2>
            <p>You get your $5.00 in River Towns Cycling Classic Voucher dollars to use as you see fit. Food, art, t-shirts, whatever you like as long as you spend it at the EXPO center or Fall Arts Festival or a Mill Street business of your choice.</p>
