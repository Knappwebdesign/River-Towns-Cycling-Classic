            <!-- Demo Derby -->
            <h2>Demo Derby</h2>

            <p>Participants assemble at the Expo Arena area at the designated time. Spectators make a circle around the participants that is just big enough for them to ride their bikes inside. Every spectator has a front row seat (or nearly front row) for this event. The riders begin to ride inside the circle in a counter clockwise direction. Why “counter clockwise”? Because that’s way more radical than clockwise; that’s why!</p>

            <p>After a few seconds of “detante” the Master of Ceremonies will indicate that the event is officially “on”. Once the event is started, riders can not “dab” or place any part of their body or an extension of their body on the ground. Only their bike’s tires are allowed on the ground. The goal is to now force your competitors to “dab”, but using various strategies. For example; you could unexpectedly jam on your brakes, causing the person behind you to “dab”. You could “merge” into the person alongside of you. You could accelerate and weave between slower riders causing them to become unnerved. So many options!</p>

            <p>As riders are eliminated, the circle of spectators needs to constantly get tighter and tighter. Eventually the field will be reduced to just two, steely participants, circling each other, eyes locked in “game face” stares, mano a mano. Cue “the good, the bad, and the ugly” music…</p>

            <p><b>You CANNOT ride in the opposite direction of the other riders. Doing so will result in disqualification.</b></p>

            <p><b>You CANNOT get overly aggressive to the point of obnoxious. The master of ceremonies has a high tolerance for nonsense, but there are limits.
Trash talking is always appreciated.</b></p>

            <p><b>Registration cost: $0.00</b></p>
            <!-- Tug of war -->
            <h2>Tug of war</h2>

            <p>Depending on the number of participants, This will be repeated in a “round robin” type manner until a winner is declared. A second place winner will also be selected, by allowing participants to continue to compete after their first “dab”, until a winner of the losers is defined. We want a second place winner selected in the event that the first place winner is involved in some scandal or another and unable to complete their duties on the talk show and speaking tour that is sure to follow this prestigious honor!</p>

            <p><b>Registration cost: $0.00</b></p>
            <!-- Log Pull -->
            <h2>Log Pull</h2>
            <p>As with the Tug of War, the log pull is a test of power and balance. However, the log pull is for those that like their adversary inadimate and covered with bark. There will be bundles of logs and chain at the starting line. Each participant will be required to attach the chain to their seat post and pull the pile of logs to the finish line. Why the seat post? Well, because our medical team told us to stop attaching the chain to rider’s necks, and so the seat post was the next skinny thing we could think of that would cause maximum leverage against the rider.</p>

            <p>If the rider dabs during the pull, they will be registered at the highest number of logs they pulled successfully. In other words, the last successful pull. In the event of a tie, a winner will be decided in a duel situation, in which the two remaining riders will take 5 paces away from each other, and then throw spoke tools at each other until one or the other rider is incapacitated.</p>

            <!-- Kids Races (up to 10 yrs old) -->
            <h2>Kids Races (up to 10 yrs old)</h2>
            <p>Who doesn’t love a kids event? Those cute little boys and girls sticking their tongues out just a little bit as they concentrate real hard on navigating the course. It’s adorable! And let’s be honest, it’s the future of our sport. Kids just aren’t riding these days. So maybe if we can convince them to have some fun and earn valuable prizes, trophies and medals in the process, we can help them get interested in riding and maybe a little less “Halo” or “Grand Theft Auto”.</p>

            <p>These kinds of events NEED to be flexible. Parents: come be a part of it, with that in mind. Organizers have been doing this for 10+ years. What we’ve learned is kids are unpredictable. And we LOVE that unpredictability! So we will adjust on the fly and respond to the curves the kids throw at us on the event day. THE GOAL IS FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE FUN! If that is not what you want for your kid, Organizers would advise you to stay away from this event. The more formal, timed, sanctioned, and serious events going on all weekend long all have beginner categories, and that might be a better fit for you and junior Lance Armstrong.</p>

            <p>So roughly, here’s how we think it will go:</p>

            <p><b>Young kids/novice</b> – Some cones, some painted lines, a short course, and then a finishers medal!</p>

            <p><b>Intermediate</b> – kids that fancy themselves proficient at riding – a more advanced course, a little longer, and we’ll do it for time.</p>

            <p><b>Advanced</b> – kids that ride all the time – more advanced course, some easy skills like riding down a board, for time.</p>

            <p><b>Registration cost: $0.00</b></p>

            <!-- Huffy Toss -->
            <h2>Huffy Toss</h2>
            <p>Who hasn’t felt like chucking a bike? Get a flat that just won’t be fixed? Derailleur that won’t shift right? Brakes that make a squeal so high in pitch that dogs bark when you try to decelerate? Well now is the time to channel all that hostility and let one of our “beater bikes” sail through the air! Rules are simple: throw the bike the furthest, and you win! We’ll give each participant three shots at it; the longest of the three is your official distance.</p>

            <p><b>Registration cost: $0.00</b></p>
            <!-- Donation -->
            <p>There will be a “DONATIONS” jar in the Information tent at the EXPO area. If you had fun at the free events, and you want to donate to the River Towns Cycling Classic, you can do so putting a few buck in the jar. Any proceeds go towards offsetting costs of the event, and the Montour Area Recreation Commission.</p>
