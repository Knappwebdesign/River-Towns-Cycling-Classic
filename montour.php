            <p>This is the full MONSTER course that has been known to humble even the strongest riders. 81.85 miles of hilly, beautiful rural (mostly), PA roads. You will get a variety of road surfaces to ride during this event. All are “roads” (technically), but some resemble war-torn Beirut, more then a country road. The Yeagle hill climb is a category 4 climb and a local legend of suffering 8% grade. And at mile 74 is the always brutal Mt. Zion road 6%. IF, you don’t walk up Mt. Zion, you may wish that you had. One rider described the hill this way, “I think this made my insides bleed.” Now, THAT’S an endorsement!</p>
            <p>The full Mon-Tour offers many options to the brave of heart. We have both sanctioned and unsanctioned options. The race selected effects the price, based on the requirements of each selection. We also offer a “Team” category for the Mon-Tour. It’s Tour de France style; first team member across the line takes the event for his team. The Mon-tour cup is then proudly presented to the winning team and that team can keep the cup in their shop/club until the next year. Each winning team is added to the cup as a historic record of the true monster teams and the men that earned the honor.</p>

            <p>These races will be fully supported. SAG support for the entire race. A wheel drop/feed zone at mile 40 (mon-tour preserve) and at mile 67 (the corner of Rt.11 and Grovania). We will have mechanics on site, bathroom facilities, Food, Drink and parking all available within walking distance of the Start location. <a href="http://www.geisingersportsmed.com/" target="_blank">Geisinger Sports Medicine</a> will provide dedicated medical staff, in the event that any medical help is needed. The <a href="http://rivertownscyclingclassic.com/expo.php" target="_blank">Expo area</a> and event parking is the Start location for this event, so we expect good spectator participation. The Micro, Mini, and Mon-tour Road races will each be chip timed.</p>

            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <p>Because this is <a href="www.RiverTownRace.com" target="_blank">River Towns Race Series</a>, riders will be awarded points toward the series based on our 11 age groups. There will be finisher medals for all finishers of all three road races. There will be an awards ceremony for top three finishers in the Mens, Womens, and Teams categories of each race. Sanctioned racers will receive their points towards category classifications. Teams will receive the Mon-Tour cup, engraving of their team name and member racers, and a cash prize (to be determined based in participation).</p>
