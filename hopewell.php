            <p>This course throws the kitchen sink at you! We mean literally: you’ll probably see a kitchen sink, as the course takes place in and around an old landfill site. Here’s what you can expect by the mile:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Mile 1</b> - This is a loop we call “Down and Dirty”. It starts with some wide rall-trail surface. This is a good place to start to sort yourselves out. Most of the course is single-track, so use your easy passing opportunities when you have them. Down and Dirty cuts off the rail-trail, down into a marsh that includes some pallet bridges, into some soft areas, and then back along a hillside trail that we call the “Goat Path”. Pretty good exposure on the left, so if you’re going to fall, fall you your right.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Mile 2</b> - Starts out like a roller coaster, but ends up as the beginning of a lung buster. The first parts of this mile will have you switchbacking up into Hopewell park, and then speeding back down into the valley in a series of banked turns that will make you look forward to the next lap. After the swooping turns, you will take the “Up and Out” trail. This trail gains some elevation, but in an interesting way. Next comes a drop into a grassy field, and then the start of the big climb up the hedge row, and into the woods. Nothing pretty here, just a bunch of lung busting, side-hill climbing.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Mile 3</b> - The first half of this mile is a climb up a logging road. But this logging road is pretty narrow, with just limited opportunity for passing. Pick you points and make your moves decisively. The second half of this mile is an enjoyable, twisty, turning, romp through the forest. Short drops and climbs will punctuate this section of trail.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Mile 4</b> - You will drop out of the forest and onto an old abandoned road for your next climb. Once on the top of this hill, you will be met with a mixture of grassy meadows, old abandoned buildings, and twisting single-track trail. Then it’s back into the woods for a fast descent, and then a long, straight climb back out of the valley.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Mile 5</b> - Catch your breath as the first half of this mile is relatively flat, ridge-top, single-track riding. The second half of mile begins your downhill fun! Fast, rolling, side-hill single-track will challenge your bike skills and your tolerance for speed.
Mile 6 - Begins with a short climb, and then down, down, down, winding your way back to the start location and the beginning of your next lap.</p>
