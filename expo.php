            <!-- General info -->
            <p>The Expo Area is the location for the start of quite a few races. It will be the place both participants and spectators go to find out what is happening, what has happened, and what will be happening at any given time. It will be a place for music, and entertainment, and gear, and food and so much more. The following things happen in the Expo area:</p>

            <!-- Beer tours -->
            <h2>Beer tours</h2>
            <p>Old Forge Brewing Company will open it’s door to it’s bottling plant for the first time ever, and give tours of the facility at 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on both days. <b>This is a special situation that has never been done before. Space will fill first come first served.</b> I’m sure some sampling will be part of the tour.</p>

            <!-- Gym Tours -->
            <h2>Gym Tours</h2>
            <p>The Anytime Fitness facility is located on the Expo Grounds. The owners of the Gym will have an “open door” policy on race weekend. So stop in, take a tour, and maybe get a membership if the spirit moves you. Being able to work out ANYTIME 24/7 – is a really cool concept.</p>

            <!-- Demo trucks -->
            <h2>Manufacturers Demo Trucks</h2>
            <p>TREK is in and others are just making final arrangements and will be announced as they commit. These Demo trucks are the place where the newest technology will be found and where you can try it for yourself. Don’t miss this opportunity to try all the new, cool gear!.</p>

            <!-- Vendors -->
            <h2>Vendors</h2>
            <p>The local bike shops that will be setting up temporary locations at the EXPO will be the place to buy new gear at great prices. You can use your River Towns Cycling Classic vouchers at all our vendor locations. Plus, get service pre-race, advice, talk shop, whatever you like. Just make sure you visit the vendors and show them so love.</p>

            <!-- Swap meet -->
            <h2>Swap Meet</h2>
            <p>There will be an area designated at which participants and fans can rent a space and sell your gear. Trade, sell, barter, whatever you like. It will be a marketplace and market of cycling enthusiasts like has never been seen before in the area!</p>

            <!-- Entertainment -->
            <h2>Entertainment</h2>
            <p>All the ‘FUN STUFF events happen in the EXPO ARENA. Log pulls, to Demo Derby’s to Kids races, to Cycling Tug-of-War. It’s all there for your enjoyment!</p>

            <!-- Music -->
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>We will have a P.A. System and music playing when we are between fun events. In the evenings we will have at least an hour of live music or a DJ play your favorite tunes.</p>
